v0.1.5
* Install script finished, we can now use the cms for new sites.
* Fixed a ton of bugs found when starting a new site and poking around.
* Sitemap will properly link your custom urls. And search will no longer search in them, which makes sense.
* In Trashcan you can now move pages with a deleted setion to an alive section.
* Headadmins can also move a page or url to a different section via the normal editor.
* Trashcan shows indirectly deleted pages/urls too (if its section is in trashcan).
* Fixed the Javascript that checks if you have cookies enabled.
* Uses PHP Classes now, this will make maintaining easier in the future.
* Ensures the admin name is unique when creating a new admin.
* Ensures the page and url name is unique for its section when creating, moving or renaming it.
* You can promote admins to headadmin. And you can rename them too.
* You can not delete or demote yourself. But you are allowed to rename.


v0.0.14
* Converted all hyperlinks (those that are changing something) to real buttons. The CMS is supposed look more like an application. 
* New page/section option: Menu name. This is the name shown in menus.
* You can now add custom urls to sections. You can link to a forum or a diffrent site for example.
* Only show top10 visited pages and ips in statistics by default.
* When moving a page/section to trashcan it gets "order" 0. Then it re-orders the current alive pages to fix holes. When reviving a page/section it assigns the last "order" number (like if the page was new). 
* Add a confirmation dialog when deleting something forever (sections, pages, admins, etc) 
* You should be able to search more characters. Convert input to html with a php function before searching.
* Translated all php comments to English. 
* Shows news with layers instead of tables. 
* Headadmins can delete admins directly from the admin overview page. 
* And lots of other undocumented changes, done in the last years.
